Portfolio Website

This is my personal data science and machine learning portfolio, built to showcase selected projects across machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, NLP, and time-series analysis.

The site highlights end-to-end projects including:

Model development and evaluation

Feature engineering and experimentation

API-based machine learning systems

Production-oriented deployment and documentation

Each project links directly to its GitHub repository with detailed explanations, code, and results.
